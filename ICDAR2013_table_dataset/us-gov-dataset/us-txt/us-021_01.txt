                     NIH Extramural Loan Repayment Programs                               FY 2011

                                   The Year in Review

         In Fiscal Year (FY) 2011, 3,159 individuals applied to the five Extramural Loan Repayment
         Programs (LRPs): Clinical Research, Pediatric Research, Health Disparities Research,
         Clinical Research for Individuals from Disadvantaged Backgrounds, and Contraception and
         Infertility Research. Of those applicants, 1,572 were awarded contracts totaling
         $72,402,447. The combined (new and renewal applicants) success rate for the Extramural
         LRPs was 50 percent.

         The Extramural Clinical Research LRP received 51 percent (1,604) of all applications.

         New applicants (those not previously funded) constituted 61 percent of all applications while
         renewal applicants (those previously funded) comprised 39 percent of all applicants.
         Success rates for new and renewal applicants were 39 and 67 percent, respectively.

         The LRPs are open to health professionals with doctoral level degrees and varying levels of
         experience. Most new FY 2011 awardees are beginning their careers, with 62 percent
         having received their qualifying degrees within the last 5 years and 94 percent within the
         past 10 years.

         Physician doctorates (including dual physician doctorates and academic doctorates, for
         example, MD/PhD degrees) comprised 51 percent of the 1,572 awards, while those with
         academic doctoral level degrees comprised 47 percent of the total awards.

         Seventy-five percent of the new awardees had educational debt greater than $50,000, with
         10 percent having debt levels greater than $200,000.

         Women received 853 of the 1,572 LRP awards. Black/African American applicants received
         118 awards. Asians received 171 awards. Hispanics received 86 awards. American
         Indians/Alaska Natives were recipients of 9 awards.

         The Division of Loan Repayment offers multiple resources for assisting applicants. This
         includes two webinars that have been watched over 7,000 times. An Overview of the Loan
         Repayment Programs summarizes the programs and gives tips for applying, and the
         Application Tutorial outlines the four sections of the application and shows applicants how to
         avoid common pitfalls. The LRP web site www.lrp.nih.gov contains links for both webinars.
