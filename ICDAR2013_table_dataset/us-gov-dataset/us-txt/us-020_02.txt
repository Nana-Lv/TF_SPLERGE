Note 4. General Property, Plant and Equipment in the Custody of Other Entities
NSF received a ruling from FASAB on accounting for PP&E owned by NSF but in the custody of and
used by others (see Note 1H). The FASAB guidance requires PP&E in the custody of others be excluded
from NSF PP&E as defined in the SFFAS No. 6, Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment. NSF is
required to disclose the dollar amount of NSF PP&E held by others in the footnotes based on information
contained in the most recently issued audited financial statements of the organization holding the assets.

At September 30, 2011, there were 25 colleges or universities, and 10 commercial entities that held
property titled to NSF. None of the colleges, universities or commercial entities reported NSF titled
property separately.

The amount of PP&E owned by NSF but in the custody of an FFRDC is identified in the table below. In
some cases, FFRDCs operate on a fiscal year-end basis other than September 30. If NSF PP&E is not
separately stated on the FFRDCâ€™s audited financial statements or the FFRDC is not audited, the related
amounts are annotated as Not Available (N/A) in the table.
