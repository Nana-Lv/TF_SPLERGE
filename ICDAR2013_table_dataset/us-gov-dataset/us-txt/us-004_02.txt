*     Based on preliminary allocations of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) appropriations.
      These figures may change. Other NNI agencies with ARRA funding, but not listed in the table, are in the process of
      determining their allocations.
**    In Tables 2–4, the 2008 and 2009 DOD figures include Congressionally directed funding that is outside the NNI plan
      ($117 million for 2009).
*** Funding levels for DOE include the Office of Science and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
**** NIH recently unveiled the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC) system, a new knowledge
      management system designed to provide more consistent and transparent information to the public about NIH research.
      The shift to the RCDC process of categorization changes the way individual research projects are assigned to categories.
      This change will result in some differences in total dollar amounts between the 2008 reports and those issued in previous
      years. Any difference, whether an increase or decrease in funding levels, does not necessarily reflect a change in the amount
      of money the NIH received from Congress or a change in the actual content of the NIH research portfolio. For more
      information about the RCDC process and some of the factors that might contribute to the differences between the
      previously reported and new RCDC-generated funding levels, please go to:
      http://report.nih.gov/rcdc/category_process/Default.aspx and http://report.nih.gov/rcdc/reasons/default.aspx.
***** For Tables 2–6, totals may not add, due to rounding.

Key points about the 2009 and 2010 NNI investments
•   Beyond the es timated $1. 66 billion i n to tal N NI i nvestments r eported u nder th e r espective 200 9
    agency appropriations, an additional $140 million has been provided for nanotechnology research and
    infrastructure investments in 2009 through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of
    2009. Note that ARRA investments shown in Table 5 are not included in Table 4. Additional 2009
    nanotechnology-related investments may be reported later, as agencies evaluate the results of funding
    opportunity announcements issued under ARRA.
•   Research on fundamental nanoscale phenomena and processes remains the largest program
    component area, growing from $478 million in 2008 to $507 million in 2010. With additional funds
    provided under ARRA, the enacted funding for this PCA in 2009 t otals $548 million. Much of the
    increase f or 2009 a nd 2010 s tems f rom increased investments a t DO E’s O ffice of Science for basic
    research on energy applications of nanoscience, and at NSF.
