                                         2. NNI INVESTMENTS
Budget Summary
The 2011 Budget provides nearly $1.8 billion for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI),
reflecting continued steady growth in the NNI investment. This sustained major investment in
nanotechnology research and development (R&D) across the Federal Government over the past eleven
years of the NNI, spanning three Presidential Administrations and five Congresses, is an indication of the
broad support for this program. This support is based on nanotechnology’s potential to vastly improve our
fundamental understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, ultimately leading to a revolution in
technology and industry for the benefit of society. While the NNI remains focused on fulfilling the
Federal role of supporting basic research, infrastructure development, and technology transfer, the
proposed investments for 2011 place renewed emphasis on accelerating the transition from basic R&D
advances and capabilities into innovations that support national priorities such as sustainable energy
technologies, healthcare, and environmental protection. This is consistent with substantial increases in the
requested nanotechnology investments for 2011 at the Department of Energy, the National Institutes of
Health, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The NNI is also increasing its investments aimed at
implementing the Government’s strategy for nanotechnology-related environmental, health, and safety
(EHS) research. 4 As a part of this expanded EHS effort, the Food and Drug Administration and the
Consumer Product Safety Commission are participating in the formal NNI budget crosscut for the first
time in 2011. Increasing investments in nanotechnology R&D by other NNI participating agencies reflect
the potential for this research to support diverse agency missions and responsibilities. The cumulative NNI
investment since 2001, including the 2011 request, now totals over $14 billion. This includes $511
million in funding authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5).
Cumulative investments in EHS research since 2005 now total over $480 million. Cumulative
investments in education and in research on ethical, legal, and other societal dimensions of
nanotechnology since 2005 total over $260 million.
The 2011 NNI budget supports nanoscale science, engineering, and technology R&D at 15 agencies.
Agencies with the largest investments are:
�   DOE (research providing a basis for new and improved energy technologies)
�   NSF (fundamental research across all disciplines of science and engineering)
�   NIH (nanotechnology-based biomedical research at the intersection of life sciences and the physical
    sciences)
�   DOD (science and engineering research advancing defense and dual-use capabilities)
�   NIST (fundamental research and development of measurement and fabrication tools, analytical
    methodologies, and metrology for nanotechnology)
Other agencies investing in mission-related research are EPA, NIOSH, NASA, FDA, DHS, USDA
(including both NIFA and FS), CPSC, DOT (including FHWA), and DOJ.
Table 2 shows NNI investments in 2009–2011 for Federal agencies with budgets and investments for
nanotechnology R&D. Tables 3–6 list the investments for 2009–2011 by agency and by program
component area (PCA).

understand and address potential risks to health and the environment that engineered nanomaterials may pose.
