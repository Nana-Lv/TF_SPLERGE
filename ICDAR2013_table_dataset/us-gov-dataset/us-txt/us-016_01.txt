Explanatory notes: Estimates include research in nanotechnology as deﬁned by the NNI (this deﬁnition does not include
MEMS, microelectronics, or general research on materials), and reﬂect the publicly reported government spending.
“W. Europe” includes countries in EU (15) and Switzerland. Rates of exchange $1 = 1.1 Euro until 2002, = 0.9 Euro in
2003, and = 0.8 Euro in 2004-2005. National and EU funding are included.
Japanese rate of exchange $1 = 120 yen until 2002, = 110 yen in 2003, = 105 yen in 2004-2005.
“Others” includes Australia, Canada, China, Eastern Europe, former Soviet Union, Israel, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and
other countries with nanotechnology R&D.

Results of the NNI Investment

There are major outcomes after the ﬁrst three years (ﬁscal years 2001-2003) of the NNI. The NNI
has already created a nanoscale science and engineering “powerhouse” of discoveries and inventions
in the United States with about 40,000 researchers, students and workers qualiﬁed at least in one
aspect of nanotechnology. The R&D landscape for nanotechnology research and education has
changed, advancing from questions, such as, “What is nanotechnology?” and “Could it ever be
developed?” to “How can we take advantage of it faster?” and “Who is the leader?” The FY 2005
NNI investment is about four times the corresponding Federal investment in FY 2000 ($1081 million
from $270 million), and the attention is extending to the legislative and even judicial branches of the
U.S. Government.

Further evidence of progress includes the following:

•     Research is advancing towards systematic control of matter at the nanoscale faster than
      envisioned in 2000, when NNI was introduced with words like “Imagine what could be done 20
      to 30 years from now.” After three years, in 2003, the NNI supports about 2,500 active awards in
      about 300 academic organizations and about 200 small businesses and nonproﬁt organizations
      in all 50 states. The time of reaching commercial prototypes has been reduced by at least a
      factor of two for several key areas such as detection of cancer, molecular electronics, and special
      nanocomposites. About half of highly cited papers by the Institute for Scientiﬁc Information,
      High-Impact Papers electronic database appear to continue to originate from the United States
      [7].
•     Systemic changes are being implemented for education, by earlier introduction of nanoscience
      and reversing the “pyramid of science” with the understanding of the unity of nature at the
