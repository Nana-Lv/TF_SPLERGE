                                  2. Introductory and Summary Comments


The NSF prepared a report entitled Societal Implications of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in
September 2000 and published it for broader public distribution in 2001 [9]. The proceedings were
followed by various program solicitations and the assignment to the National Nanotechnology
Coordination Ofﬁce (NNCO) in 2001 of a monitoring role for potential unexpected societal
implications. The NNCO also has the role of communicating with the public.

In 2003, a subgroup of the NSET Subcommittee, the Nanotechnology Environmental and Health
Implications (NEHI) working group, was established to address environment, health, and safety
(EHS) issues. Among those issues are identiﬁcation and prioritization of EHS research needs and
communication of information pertaining to the EHS aspects of nanomaterials to researchers and
others who handle and use nanomaterials.

In another follow-up to the 2000 Societal Implications report, NSF has made support for social,
ethical, and economic research studies a priority by (a) including this as a new theme in the NSF
annual program solicitations since 2000; (b) requiring its nanotechnology research and education
centers to address societal implications of the research performed in the respective center; and (c)
conducting a study on the impact of technology and converging technologies from the nanoscale
[10].

NSF has pursued the research and education themes “Nanoscale processes in the environment”
and “Societal and Educational Implications of Nanotechnology” as part of its NNI programs since
July 2000 (annual program solicitations NSF 00-119, 01-157, 02-148, 03-043, 03-044), and 100
examples of awards made in this area are posted on www.nsf.gov/nano, listed under Solicitations
and Outcomes. Examples of projects supporting societal implications are given in Table 2.3. EPA
has had annual program announcements in the STAR program with focus on nanotechnology and
