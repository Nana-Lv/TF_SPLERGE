Instructions. To figure how much income tax to
withhold from the wages paid to a nonresident alien
employee performing services in the United States, use
the following steps.

    Step 1. Add to the wages paid to the nonresident
alien employee for the payroll period the amount shown
in the chart below for the applicable payroll period.

     Amount to Add to Nonresident Alien
 Employeeâ€™s Wages for Calculating Income Tax
             Withholding Only

 Payroll Period                          Add Additional
 Weekly                                    $ 40.40
 Biweekly                                      80.80
 Semimonthly                                   87.50
 Monthly                                      175.00
 Quarterly                                    525.00
 Semiannually                               1,050.00
 Annually                                   2,100.00
 Daily or Miscellaneous                         8.10
  (each day of the payroll period)


   Step 2. Use the amount figured in Step 1 and the
number of withholding allowances claimed (generally
limited to one allowance) to figure income tax
withholding. Determine the value of withholding
allowances by multiplying the number of withholding
allowances claimed by the appropriate amount in the
table shown on the previous page. Reduce the amount
figured in Step 1 by the value of withholding allowances
and use that reduced amount to determine the wages
subject to income tax withholding. Figure the income tax
withholding using the Percentage Method Tables for
Income Tax Withholding provided on the next two pages
or the Wage Bracket Tables for Income Tax Withholding
that will be published later in Publication 15 (Circular E).
