                    METROPOLITAN SCHOOL DISTRICT OF DECATUR TOWNSHIP
                              AUDIT RESULTS AND COMMENTS
                                       (Continued)


        Officials and employees have the duty to pay claims and remit taxes in a timely fashion. Failure to
pay claims or remit taxes in a timely manner could be an indicator of serious financial problems which
should be investigated by the governmental unit.

        Additionally, officials and employees have a responsibility to perform duties in a manner which would
not result in any unreasonable fees being assessed against the governmental unit.

         Any penalties, interest or other charges paid by the governmental unit may be the personal obligation
of the responsible official or employee.

CASH NECESSARY TO BALANCE, BANK RECONCILIATIONS

         A comparison of the records to the bank account indicated cash necessary to balance of $1,701.20 at
June 30, 2011. A similar comment appeared in prior Report B35979. A number of previous errors were
identified and corrected during the current audit period which reduced the cash necessary to balance to its
current level.

        At all times, the manual and/or computerized records, subsidiary ledgers, control ledger, and recon-
ciled bank balance should agree. If the reconciled bank balance is less than the subsidiary or control ledgers,
then the responsible official or employee may be held personally responsible for the amount needed to
balance the fund. (Accounting and Uniform Compliance Guidelines Manual for Indiana Public School
Corporations, Chapter 9)


SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR TRAVEL CLAIMS

         The School Corporation has credit card and travel policies but the policies and guidelines were not
always followed. The credit card policy required submission of an original detailed receipt. The original
receipt and/or a detailed receipt were not always provided for inspection.

         The travel policy also required all original detailed receipts to be submitted, but in some instances
original detailed receipts were not provided. Additionally, there was a separate School Corporation policy for
travel expenses related to federal grants. The policy for federal grants limited the tip amount to 15 percent.
The School Corporation travel policy for general expenses did not include guidelines for tips. The travel poli-
cies or guidelines do not define travel status and what meals are appropriate for in-district meetings.

        Credit card and travel claims were tested. We identified the following deficiencies:

        �    On the majority of claims tested, meals were either reimbursed or charged to the district
             credit card without adequate supporting documentation. These items totaled $761.96.

        �    On the majority of claims tested, meals were paid for in or around Indianapolis totaling
             $1,257.33.

        �    On the claims tested tips were paid in excess of 15 percent. The maximum tip given was
             36 percent.
