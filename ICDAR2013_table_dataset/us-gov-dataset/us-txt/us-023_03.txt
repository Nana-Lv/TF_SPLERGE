pesticides plus other pesticide chemicals, the U.S. accounts for about one-fifth of such usage world
wide. Chlorine/hypochlorites are the leading type of pesticides in the U.S., with half of the U.S. total.
Wood preservatives and specialty biocides make up the remainder of the U.S. total of 4.52 billion
pounds in 1995. The above quantities equal 4.6 pounds per capita in the U.S. for conventional
pesticides plus sulfur, etc., and 17.0 pounds per capita for the total of all types.

Expenditures for Pesticides
      The pesticide industry is quite significant in dollar terms. Annual expenditures by users of
pesticides totalled $11.3 billion in 1995 (conventional pesticides plus sulfur, etc.). Of this, 70 percent
was for use in agriculture (a total of $7.9 billion — an average of nearly $4,200 per farm in the U.S. —
for 1.9 million farms). The U.S. total of $11.3 billion equals $43 per capita in the U.S. The average U.S.
household had expenditures of about $20 for pesticides applied by the homeowner. (This does not
include expenditures for pesticides applied to homes and gardens by others for hire.) The U.S.
accounts for nearly one-third of pesticide user expenditures world wide.

Numbers of Pesticide Producers and Users
      The U.S. pesticide sector involves the following numbers of firms and individuals (approximate
numbers); major pesticide manufacturers (18); other manufacturers (100); manufacturing workers
(6-10,000); producing establishments (7,300); formulators (2,200); distributors/establishments (17,000);
farms using pesticides (1.4 mil. out of 1.9 mil. total); commercial pest control firms (35-40,000);
certified commercial applicators (384,000); households using pesticides (70 mil. out of 95 mil. total).

Trends in Conventional Pesticide Usage
     Agriculture: Usage of conventional pesticides on farms increased from about 400 mil. lbs. in
the mid-1960s to a peak of nearly 850 mil. lbs. around 1980, primarily due to the widespread
adoption of herbicides in crop production. Since that time, usage has been somewhat lower and has
varied from a low of 658 mil. lbs. in 1987 to a high of 786 mil. lbs in 1994 (active ingredient basis).
Pesticide usage in agriculture can vary considerably from year to year depending on weather, pest
outbreaks, crop acreage and economic factors such as crop prices.
      Usage of conventional pesticides in agriculture increased noticeably in 1994 (by about 11
percent over 1993) due to more acreages grown for important pesticide-using crops (principally corn
and soybeans) and due to impacts of floods/unseasonable weather during the 1993/94 period in
midwest and western states. The total U.S. acreage of corn and soybeans grown increased about 7
mil. in 1994 over 1993. Acreages of cotton, rice and sunflowers also increased in 1994. The flooding in
1993 accelerated weed infestation problems in 1994, resulting in more herbicide usage. The need for
herbicides in 1994 was intensified due to wet soil conditions and reduced usage of post-harvest
herbicide applications in 1993. Also flooding conditions had the effect of moving weed seeds into
new areas. Within midwest states, the areas most affected by flooding had reduced herbicide usage
in 1993 compared to other areas. Then, in 1994, herbicide usage in the most affected areas increased
much more than in the less flooded areas. Herbicides accounted for most of the increase in agricul-
tural pesticide usage in 1994 over 1993 (60 mil. out of 80 mil. pound increase in conventional usage).
    Other Sectors: In the non-agricultural sectors, conventional pesticide usage reached a peak of
more than 300 mil. lbs. in the 1970s and has declined rather consistently since 1980—to a level of
about 200 mil. lbs. in 1995. Most of this decline is due to less usage in the industrial/commercial/
governmental sector (referred to as the professional market) which totalled 128 mil. lbs. in 1995.
Usage of conventional pesticides by homeowners is estimated at 74 mil. lbs. for 1995.
