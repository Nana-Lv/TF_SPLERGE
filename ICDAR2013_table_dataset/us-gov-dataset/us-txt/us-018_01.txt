                             Financial Discussion and Analysis
In these challenging budgetary times, the federal government has turned to Chief Financial Officers to
offer solutions that will enable agencies to serve the American people more effectively. NSF has
responded by building on business services that work smarter, better, and more efficiently. One way we
have done this through additional risk management analysis of our operations. Effective risk management
helps us to better set priorities while avoiding unnecessary costs. For example, as part of its internal
control program, NSF performs risk-based internal control assessments that cover a range of business
processes. These assessments are integrated with system reviews to gain efficiencies. NSF has also
developed new tools to facilitate award management and the monitoring of expenditure rates. The
agency’s move towards modernizing its financial systems and contracting and grant management
processes has allowed us to make strides towards improving the availability and transparency of financial
information with the result of operating more efficiently. During FY 2011, NSF moved forward with the
planning and acquisition of a new financial management system (see discussion on “Financial System
Strategy” on page 1-25). In addition, our current award oversight activities are based upon risk
assessments of funding. The risk assessment process is consistently reviewed based on results and
experience.

As responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars, NSF prepares annual financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for U.S. federal government entities. The financial
statements present NSF’s detailed financial information relative to its mission and the stewardship of
those resources entrusted to the agency. It also provides readers with an understanding of the resources
that NSF has available for use, the cost of our programs, and the status of resources at the end of the fiscal
year. NSF subjects its financial statements to an independent audit to ensure that they are free from
material misstatement and can be used to assess NSF’s financial status and related financial activity for
the years ending September 30, 2011 and 2010. For FY 2011, NSF received its 14th consecutive
unqualified audit opinion. The audit report noted no material weaknesses. In addition, the report no longer
includes the prior year significant deficiency related to the monitoring of cost reimbursement contracts.
This is largely the result of the agency’s efforts to obtain incurred cost audits for high-risk contracts to
ensure the reasonableness and accuracy of costs paid on contracts. However, the audit report includes a
new significant deficiency related to cooperative agreements with budgeted contingency amounts.
Although management does not concur with the significant deficiency, NSF will continue to work
towards reaching agreement and resolving the concerns reported. A detailed discussion of the independent
audit is included in the audit report which can be found on page II-3.
