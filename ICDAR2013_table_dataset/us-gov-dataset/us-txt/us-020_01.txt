The Donations Account includes amounts donated to NSF from all sources. Funds in the Donations
Account may be used to further one or more of the general purposes of the Foundation. The donated
funds are held as FBWT or as non-FBWT with budgetary resources, which represent cash held outside of
Treasury at commercial banks in interest-bearing accounts. These funds are collateralized up to $53.5
million by the bank, through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in accordance with Treasury
Financial Manual Volume 1, Chapter 6-9000. Unobligated Unavailable balances include recoveries of
prior year obligations and other unobligated expired funds that are unavailable for new obligations.

In FY 1999, in accordance with P.L. 105-277, a special fund named H-1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Fees
Account was established in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. These funds are considered Earmarked
Funds and are not included in Appropriated Funds. The funds represent fees collected for each petition for
nonimmigrant status. Under the law, NSF was prescribed a percentage of these fees for specific programs.
