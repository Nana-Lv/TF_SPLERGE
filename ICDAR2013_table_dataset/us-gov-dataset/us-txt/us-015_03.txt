NNI AFTER THREE YEARS (2001-2003): SETTING NEW TARGETS FOR
RESPONSIBLE NANOTECHNOLOGY†

M.C. Roco, National Science and Technology Council, National Science Foundation

                                                       The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is a visionary
                                                       research and development program that coordinates 23
                                                       departments and independent agencies; the total investment
                                                       in ﬁscal year (FY) 2004 was about $1 billion. The program
                                                       started formally in FY 2001 (October 2000) and was the result
                                                       of the bottom-up proposal of an interagency group on nanoscale
                                                       science and engineering that got started in 1996 [1, 2, 3]. The
                                                       Federal nanotechnology investment per agency since the
                                                       beginning of NNI is given in Table 2.1.
