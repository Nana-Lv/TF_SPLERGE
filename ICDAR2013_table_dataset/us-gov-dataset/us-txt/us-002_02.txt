     report additional ARRA funding for SBIR and STTR projects later, when 2009 SBIR/STTR data become available.
**   Funding levels for DOE include the Office of Science, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Office
     of Fossil Energy, the Office of Nuclear Energy, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy.
*** In Tables 2–4, the 2009 and 2010 DOD figures include Congressionally directed funding that is outside the NNI plan
     ($117 million for 2009).

Key points about the 2010 and 2011 NNI investments
�    Beyond the $1.7 billion in total NNI investments reported under the respective 2009 agency
     appropriations, an additional $511 million was provided for nanotechnology research and
     infrastructure investments in 2009 through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of
     2009. This substantial ARRA enhancement to the NNI in 2009 included investments across all of the
     NNI PCAs, with particular emphasis on PCA 2 (nanomaterials, where DOE alone increased its
     investment by $138 million) and on PCA 6 (major research facilities & instrumentation acquisition),
     where NIST, DOE, and NSF allocated over $72 million to upgrade equipment and facilities at NNI
     user facilities and research centers.
�    Research on fundamental nanoscale phenomena and processes (PCA 1) remains the largest program
     component area, with $484 million requested for 2011. Combined with PCA 2 (nanomaterials, $342
     million in the 2011 request), this basic research component of the NNI portfolio represents just under
     half of the total NNI funding request, reflecting the continued importance of sustained Federal
     funding for fundamental research, feeding the innovation pipeline.
�    The Department of Energy now has the largest nanotechnology investment among the NNI agencies,
     requesting a total of $424 million for 2011. The increase in 2011 over 2010 is due in part to new
     investments at the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA–E), as well as increased
     funding at the Office of Science and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
