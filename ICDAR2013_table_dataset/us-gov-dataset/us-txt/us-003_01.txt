                    METROPOLITAN SCHOOL DISTRICT OF DECATUR TOWNSHIP
                              AUDIT RESULTS AND COMMENTS



QUESTIONED COST â€“ PROPERTY TAXES PAID

       Based on information presented for audit, the School Corporation failed to record one of their property
tax exemptions timely. The exemption relates to a specific property which was acquired by the School
Corporation in November of 2006. If the related property tax exemption would have been filed timely with the
Marion County Auditor's Office prior to May of 2007 then the School Corporation would have been exempt
from paying any property taxes on the property.

        The School Corporation did not file for their exemption until May of 2011.

          During the audit period, the School Corporation has paid $279,512.13 in property taxes and
$13,986.78 in penalty to the Marion County Treasurer. The School Corporation made an additional property
tax payment in October of 2011 in the amount of $45,436.50, resulting in total property tax and penalty
payments in the amount of $338,935.41. No additional property taxes should be charged as the exemption
filed in May of 2011 will be in effect for the May 2012 property tax cycle. Current officials are seeking a way
to refund these payments to the School Corporation.

        Below is a summary of the taxes and penalties paid by the School Corporation:
