was necessary to update it applying the annual inflation rate until 2006 for each
case and convert it into Euros applying the exchange rate provided by The
European Central Bank (year 2006). This was the case for those averages obtained
from some studies considered, and for which data was derived from previous years.
The results are presented in the following figure, in EURO, without applying the
PPS:

  Figure 9 – Researchers' remuneration averages in the different non-European countries

In order to make those figures comparable to the researchers’ remunerations in
Europe, they were converted into PPS. The corrective coefficients were used to
present the following table, where the comparison of the researchers’
remunerations in the different non-European countries as Australia, China, India,
Japan and the United States (total country average) against the situation in Europe
is shown.
