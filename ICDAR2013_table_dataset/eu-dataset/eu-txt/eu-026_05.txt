       to normal) has returned to its historical average. Until recently, PMI surveys also tended to point
       towards a pattern of accelerated reduction in input and retail inventories in the fourth quarter of 2011
       and, to a lesser extent, in ﬁnished goods inventories by manufacturers (reﬂecting some involuntary
       additions to such inventories or smaller declines than expected).

       This new conﬁguration explains the negative contributions of inventories to growth of -0.2
       percentage point in both the third and fourth quarters of 2011, reversing the sequence of mostly
       positive contributions observed in the previous eight quarters. Taking into account the slowdown in
       activity and the pace of restocking in national accounts, there is potential for some further negative
       contributions over the coming quarters. However, given the starting point of fairly lean inventories,
       the scope for a pronounced destocking similar to that observed after the bankruptcy of Lehman
       Brothers is very limited at this stage. More recent survey evidence (both from the European
       Commission and the PMI) in February 2012 that points towards a fairly abrupt slowdown in the
       pace of destocking might suggest an earlier than expected reversal.

       EXTERNAL TRADE
       Euro area imports continued to lag behind exports in the ﬁnal quarter of 2011 in line with the
       pattern seen throughout the year. In fact, imports and exports of goods and services declined quarter
       on quarter by 1.2% and 0.4% respectively in the fourth quarter. These developments resulted in a
       positive contribution from net trade of 0.3 percentage point to euro area GDP growth in the fourth
       quarter of 2011. Remarkably, net trade has supported GDP growth since the euro area started to
       recover from the global ﬁnancial crisis in
       mid-2009, except for a marginally negative            Chart 53 Euro area export volumes
