It is evident from the table above that there are different levels of involvement of the social
partners in different countries, and that the involvement may take on different forms.
Accordingly, while Belgium and Italy use relatively more collective bargaining on continuing
education and training than work councils, other countries, such as Germany, Austria and the
Netherlands place relatively greater emphasis on the existence of indirect or representational
employee participation at company or workplace level through elected work councils, rather
than collective bargaining. Meanwhile, Denmark and France have extensive involvement of
the social partners through both collective bargaining and work councils.

Moreover, it is important to note that the role of employers is not limited to involvement in
dialogue with employee representatives. Rather, employers may decide to take the lead in
providing training opportunities for their employees. This is reflected in differences in the
overall expenditure of employers on continuing vocational training. It is of interest to note
that there is no direct apparent relationship between the level of social partner dialogue on
adult education and training issues, and the level of expenditure on continuing vocational
training by employers. Accordingly, the UK which has little dialogue between social partners
has experienced significant increases in the level of employer expenditure on continuing
vocational training (see table below) in the 1990s.
