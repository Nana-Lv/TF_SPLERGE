     The Observatory has been commissioned by Marché du Film/Festival de Cannes (MIF) to
     prepare synthetic statistics on world film market trends. These statistics are printed, published
     and mainly distributed by MIF under the name "FOCUS" at the Cannes film festival to all
     accredited professionals (about 8,500 copies). "FOCUS" is largely identified with the
     Observatory, which also disseminate about 2,000 copies among its customers, professional
     partners and members.

     The study "Public Funding for film and audiovisual works in Europe – A comparative
     approach", published in 2004, is considered to be a commercial success: by August 2006, 601
     copies were sold and some 550 copies where distributed free of charge.

     For the report "Film Distribution Companies in Europeis", which is expected to be launched
     by fall 2006, marketing plans foresee a distribution of 450 copies free of charge and a
     minimum sales target of 200 copies.
