Finally, regarding unemployed adults there are increasing responsibilities on the individual to
undertake training as part of activation schemes. The participation in continuing education
and training is thus increasingly becoming a condition for receipt of unemployment benefits.
This has been particularly evident in countries that have undertaken considerable reforms of
their labour market policies, such as Denmark.

Overall patterns

It is evident from the above that the responsibility for providing and facilitating learning for
adults is falling on different stakeholders in different countries. While some countries rely
predominantly on the public sector to fund and provide adult education and training
opportunities, other countries are moving towards a more commercial provision, with
individual employers and employees taking on increasing responsibility. For example, in
Finland, “perhaps the most striking feature of adult learning today is the regulated market,
heavily subsidised by the state and regional administrations. There is a marked absence of a
thriving commercial provision that characterises learning opportunities for adults in many
other OECD countries”165. In contrast, for countries such as the US and UK the private
funding of adult education and training by employers and employees is far more pronounced.
