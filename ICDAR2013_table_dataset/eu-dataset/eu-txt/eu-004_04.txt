                            Access to education and training in Europe




High overall costs can deter individuals from attending HE, more so for those from lower
income groups. The crucial factor, therefore, it has been argued (Bar:2003), is to make higher
education affordable at the point of use. If amounts are sufficient and used to maximum
effect, grants and loans should be able to do much to re-dress the income inequalities that may
put off lower income groups. In addition, if re-payment of student loans is income contingent
and deferred to a time when it is realistically affordable, then any debt accrued should
become manageable.

It is likely that the UK system has not gone far enough on this front to date; although the
system changes signalled by introduction of tuition fees do not appear to have strengthened
the relationship between participation and social class, they clearly have done nothing to
diminish it either. Results from the Global Rankings study confirm that affordability is about
more than tuition fees. The UK rates very poorly on affordability but this is less to do with
tuition fees and more to do with high living costs and insufficient financial aid. Conversely,
Finland and Netherlands are affordable because they have very good financial support
systems and lower living costs, even though one has fees and the other does not.

However, the overwhelming consensus suggests that attempts to widening participation must
not focus exclusively on the HE entry point. Inequalities in aspirations and attainment are
shown to develop earlier in the schooling career, and these affect access to HE, amongst other
factors.
