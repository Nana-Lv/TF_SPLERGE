Note: Trade weights for the EER-20 and EER-12 can be obtained by proportionally rescaling the corresponding countries’ trade weights
in such a way that they add up to 100.


The historically largest group of trading partners in terms of their combined weight in the EER 40
of the euro consists of “other European economies”,5 the weight of which rose steadily from
slightly above 25% in the period 1995-97 to above 30% in the period 2007-09. The growing
importance of the other European economies as major trading partners reﬂects the geographical
proximity and increasing economic integration within Europe. In fact, the increase in the weight
