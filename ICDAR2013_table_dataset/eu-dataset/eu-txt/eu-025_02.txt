       visible in the processed food component (excluding tobacco), owing to increases in the prices of
       commodity-intensive items, such as dairy products, oil and fats and, in particular, coffee and tea.

       Excluding all food and energy items, which represent around 30% of the HICP basket, annual
       HICP inﬂation decreased to 1.5% in January 2012, having been stable at 1.6% from September
       to December 2011. HICP inﬂation excluding total food and energy is determined predominantly
       by domestic factors, such as wages, proﬁt mark-ups and indirect taxes, and it consists of two
       main components, namely non-energy industrial goods and services. Developments in these two
       components have been very different.

       In 2011 non-energy industrial goods inﬂation showed an upward trend, which had started in the
       second quarter of 2010, owing to the pass-through of past exchange rate depreciation and commodity
       price increases, as well as hikes in indirect taxes. Over the last few months of 2011 non-energy
       industrial goods inﬂation stood at around 1.2%, following a high degree of volatility earlier in the
       year. This volatility was related to the introduction of a new regulation on the treatment of seasonal
       products in the HICP, which had a large impact on the semi-durable goods sub-component (clothing
       materials, textiles, books, etc.). The other two sub-components of the non-energy industrial goods
       component, namely durable goods (cars, furniture, electronic appliances, etc.) and non-durable
       goods (water supply, pharmaceutical products, newspapers, etc.), remained more stable. In January
       2012 the annual rate of change in non-energy industrial goods prices dropped to 0.9%.

       Services price inﬂation rose notably in the ﬁrst few months of 2011. It then hovered around 1.9%
       from April of that year. This stabilisation was evident in all the main services sub-components,
       with the exception of communication services, which exhibited a stronger decline in the annual rate
       of change. In January 2012 services price inﬂation stood at 1.9% for the third consecutive month.
       Declines in the annual rate of change in transport services, communication services, and recreation
       and personal services were counterbalanced by
       increases in the annual rate of change in housing
