         is assumed to be 1.5 percentage points lower, i.e. at about 2.5% on average between 2014 and
         2020, under the same growth assumptions debt would stabilise at slightly below 110% of GDP
         by 2020 (see Chart B).

         Assuming a more adverse GDP decline in the short term

         Two further departures from the baseline scenario are analysed below. First, it is assumed that
         a very negative shock to GDP takes place between 2012 and 2013. This shock is calibrated to
         broadly match the current lower bound of GDP forecasts among market analysts for 2012 and
         2013. This corresponds to a two-percentage-point reduction in GDP growth per year compared
         with the baseline scenario (see Chart A).

         This scenario shows that such a shock to GDP, which is summarised by a cumulated GDP fall
         of 7% until the end of 2013, would lead to a temporary increase in the stock of debt to 124% of
         GDP in 2013. In this adverse scenario, it is assumed that there is no recovery in the loss of GDP
         and that ﬁscal policy remains passive, i.e. there is no extra consolidation effort in response to the
         worsening macroeconomic scenario, which leads to a two-year delay in achieving the 3% deﬁcit
