 to some adjustment in the overall trade weights through the double export weights. In particular,
 in the case of China, as well as Japan and other Asian economies, competition between euro area
 and Asian exporters in third countries results in a signiﬁcant increase in the overall trade weight
 beyond the levels implied by direct export linkages.

 The recent update of the trade weights leads to a revision of the nominal and real EERs of the euro
 from 2007. Chart C shows the previous and the revised real EER-40 indices (deﬂated by consumer
 prices). In December 2011 the revised EER-40 had a value of 95.7 and thus stood 6.8% below its
 level at the beginning of 2007. Based on the previous weighting scheme, the index would have
 reached a value of 96.9 and would thus have been 5.6% lower than in January 2007. The update of
 the trade weights therefore reveals that the increase in competitiveness of the euro area owing to
 the real depreciation of the single currency since 2007 was slightly more pronounced if changes in
 the geographical composition of euro area trade are taken into account.


1.4 OUTLOOK FOR THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

Looking ahead and notwithstanding the improved short-term outlook, medium-term global
growth prospects are expected to remain subdued as advanced economies are expected to continue
to face signiﬁcant growth impediments.
