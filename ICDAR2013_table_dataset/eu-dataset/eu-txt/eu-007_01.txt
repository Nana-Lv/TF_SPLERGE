                      Access to education and training in Europe: Qualitative Reviews


setting up priorities for education and co-financing education, and training activities and HRD
regional councils have been established; a similar trend can be seen in Slovakia with the
transfer of competencies on education and employment to eight regions and the ongoing
establishment of regional councils for VET; so too in Slovenia with Regional Human
Resource councils; in Turkey with regional districts boards for public education; in Romania
with local committees for the development of social partnership in vocational education and
training (VET); and in Hungary where the Development and Training Sub-Fund is allocated
to regions according to their priorities, and regional centres of excellence have been set up as
part of the Regional Operational Programmes (in the context of the preparation for Structural
Funds). In Poland, regions (voivodship) and districts (powiat) play a major role in setting up
education and employment related priorities, and coordination with the State is difficult and
poor”155.

In addition, while countries like Denmark, France, Italy and the UK have decentralised to
regions (a trend which can be seen as a contribution to the objective of improving insight into
learning demand and bringing learning closer to home), they and others such as Germany and
Finland also show a tendency to increase the powers of individual education and training
institutions and to strengthen the role of regional stakeholders in regional consultation
structures (e.g. France). The enhanced role and responsibility of the individual education and
training institutions is particularly prevalent in the UK.

It is also noteworthy that in countries that have been major beneficiaries of EU structural
funds, such as Spain, Greece, Portugal and the new accession countries, the EU rather than
national governments is a primary provider of funds for adult education and training
programmes. Notably, in the New Member States, accession and candidate countries, “the
increase and diversification of Phare funding which now covers most of the main LLL
[lifelong learning] priorities through activities to support the renovation of schools, provide
technical equipment, and modernise and create counselling and guidance centres, now play a
significant role in the major fields of reforms of education and training systems, as do the
United Nations Development Programme grants and World Bank loans in some countries, the
developments of the EU programmes Leonardo da Vinci and Socrates and the EU initiative
EQUAL”156.

Hence, it is evident from the above that while there are general trends across countries
towards greater decentralisation and improving the efficiency of adult education and training,
it is important to note that “policy responses vary according to a country’s economic and
social contexts, the historical development of its education systems, and the political
structures and systems in place”157.
