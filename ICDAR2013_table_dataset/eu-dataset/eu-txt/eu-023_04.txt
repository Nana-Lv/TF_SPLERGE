         of this group of countries is largely accounted for by non-euro area Member States that have
         joined the European Union since 2004. Since the period 1995-97 their combined weight has
         doubled to above 14% of the EER-40 basket, which corresponds to more than eight times their
         combined share in world GDP and thus underlines the particular importance of trade linkages
         between these countries and the euro area.
