to public HEI (ensino superior course) are controlled exclusively by the Ministry of Science
and Higher Education and are fixed and published annually by the authorities of the
institutions involved, accompanied by the respective justification. Each school of ensino
superior sets the tests it demands for entrance to each of its courses, for which it may use
national secondary education exams ( a procedure adapted in the 2001/02 school year) or
other tests expressly designed for this purpose.

In the 1990s there has been a rapid growth in the number of commercially run private tertiary
education establishments in many Central and Eastern European countries, and indeed, in
Greece and Spain. This has taken place in response to a high level of demand for access to
higher education in general, or for higher education of a particular type

Tuition fees

In Europe there is large variation in the organisation and levels of tuition fees in higher
education. Table 5 provides a summary of this variety, based on data from 1999-2000, which
questions the impact of tuition fees at their current level on access to tertiary education in
Europe147. Also the average grant is shown. The only country where tuition fees are at a
considerable level and students on average could pay these tuition fees from the public grant
subsidies they receive is the Netherlands. In the UK with even more substantial levels of
tuition fees, the average grants given to students fall far below the level given to Dutch
students.

Recently a Dutch study has been published on Perceptions of student price responsiveness148.
The study states that “many studies across a wide range of countries have come to the
conclusion that financial incentives like tuition fees, grants and loans hardly impact students’
choices and their enrolment patterns (Leslie and Brinkman, 1987, Heller, 1997, De Jong et al.,
2001). Only a small number of studies indicate that developments towards cost sharing
