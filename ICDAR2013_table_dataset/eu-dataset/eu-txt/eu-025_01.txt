 countries with signiﬁcant impacts included Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and Italy. In the latter
 country, although the VAT increase was only introduced in September 2011, it still led to a
 mechanical impact of 0.2 percentage point for 2011 as a whole (see Chart B).

 Looking ahead, a number of countries have implemented or announced VAT increases that
 will have an impact in 2012, including Ireland, Cyprus, Italy, France and Portugal. This will
 result in continued upward pressure on inﬂation rates this year (see Box 10, entitled “ECB staff
 macroeconomic projections for the euro area”).
