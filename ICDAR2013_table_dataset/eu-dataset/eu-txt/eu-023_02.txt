         The trade weights are revised and updated every three years to provide an accurate picture of
         trade patterns. Owing to limitations of data availability, the calculations occur with a time lag.
         In the most recent update carried out in January 2012, trade weights were added for the period
         from 2007 to 2009.1

         The EERs are constructed by applying the weights to the bilateral nominal exchange rates of
         the euro against the currencies of selected trading partners. Real EER indices are derived by
         adjusting the nominal indices for relative price and cost developments between the euro area
         and its trading partners.2 The trade weights combine information on exports and imports,
         excluding intra-euro area trade. Import weights consist of each trading partner’s simple share in
         total euro area imports. Export weights, on the other hand, are double-weighted to account for
         “third-market effects”. Speciﬁcally, they capture the effect of competition faced by euro area
         exporters in foreign markets not only from domestic producers, but also from exporters from
         third countries. The overall weight of each partner country is obtained as the weighted average
         of the export and import weights.3

         The table presents the trade weights over all available periods for each of the countries included
         in the broad EER-40 (listed in the order of their average trade weight over all periods).4 Advanced
         economies continue to account for a sizeable share of euro area trade, although the weight
         of the largest advanced economies in the EER-40 of the euro has been declining over time.
         Between 1995 and 2009 the two individual countries with the largest weights were, on average,
         the United States and the United Kingdom, which together accounted for almost a third of the
         EER-40. These countries, together with Japan, were also the three largest individual trading
         partners of the euro area in the period 1995-2000, with a combined weight of, on average, around
         45% of the EER-40 basket. However, for the period 2007-09 their combined share in the basket
         of the EER-40 declined to around 30%.

         The decrease in the share of the largest advanced economies in the EER-40 basket is not due to
         a decline in trade with the euro area, but instead reﬂects the rising importance of other regions,
         in particular emerging market economies, in the global economy. As a consequence, the
         combined weight of trading partners from emerging Asia in the EER-40 rose from below 19%
         in the period 1995-97 to above 27% in the period 2007-09. This rise resulted mainly from
         a substantial increase in the weight of China, which became the euro area’s largest individual
         trading partner in the period 2007-09. The share of other emerging Asian economies has
         remained broadly unchanged over time, as can be seen in Chart A, which presents developments
         in the trade weights of major regions of the world economy, as well as of some of the euro area’s
         largest individual trading partners.

         1 The weights are based on bilateral trade data on manufactured goods, as deﬁned in Sections 5-8 of the Standard International Trade
           Classiﬁcation for the periods 1995-97, 1998-2000, 2001-03, 2004-06 and 2007-09. Manufacturing goods are chosen as the trade basis
           for the weights as these are typically most responsive to changes in competitiveness.
         2 The real EERs are calculated on the basis of consumer price indices, producer price indices, GDP deﬂators and unit labour cost
           indices – the latter for the total economy as well as the manufacturing sector.
         3 See Buldorini, L., Makrydakis, S. and Thimann, C., “The effective exchange rates of the euro”, Occasional Paper Series, No 2, ECB, 2002.
         4 The ECB publishes nominal and real EERs of the euro against three groups of trading partners: the EER-12, comprising Australia,
           Canada, Denmark, Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
           United States; the EER-20, consisting of the EER-12 plus China and the seven non-euro area EU Member States not included in the
           EER-12; and the EER-40, comprising the EER-20 plus 20 additional relevant trading partners (see the table for the complete list).
           The trade weights are calculated for the EER-40 group of trading partners. For the EER-12 and EER-20 groups, they are obtained by
           proportionally rescaling the corresponding countries’ trade weights in such a way that they add up to 100.
