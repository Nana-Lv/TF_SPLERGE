A number of common concerns are evident from the written comments provided:

•     Stakeholders require further information about the Commission’s proposals in order to
      further the debate. This applies, in particular, to the new approaches proposed for basic research
      and for European technology initiatives. The Commission has in the meantime made available
      working documents covering many of the objectives set out in the Communication.2

•     Stakeholders want improvements in implementation of the Framework Programme. Many
      of the concerns coincide with those found in the mid term evaluation of the effectiveness of the
      instruments of the 6th Framework Programme conducted by an independent panel led by
      Professor Marimon. Many of these concerns are being addressed by the Commission in its
      response to the panel’s report and an action plan has been established. 3
