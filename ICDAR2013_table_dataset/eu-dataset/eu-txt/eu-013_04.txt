 Figure 10 – Deviation of the researchers’ remunerations in the different countries from the
                               EU25 average, in terms of PPS

The graphic highlights that the most attractive countries for researchers, in terms
of remuneration, are Austria, Israel Switzerland, Australia and the United States.
However, it is important to remark that the corrective coefficient of Israel was
calculated in 2003, and it may have varied since then.

On the other hand, the corrective coefficient for China, calculated by the World
Bank, is based on a 1986 bilateral comparison of China and the United States
(Rouen and Kai 1995), employing a different methodology than that used for other
countries. Given the rise of the Chinese economy during the last years, its accuracy
should be carefully considered7.

  China is participating in the current round of the International Comparison Program, which
should give fresh data by the end of 2007.
