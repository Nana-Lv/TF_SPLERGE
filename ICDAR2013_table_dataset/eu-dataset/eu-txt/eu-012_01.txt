Dividing the researchers’ remunerations obtained in the survey by the appropriate
corrective coefficient we obtain a salary in terms of PPS. The comparison of those
salaries, in terms of standardised PPS, takes into consideration the different cost of
living in each country. In this way, the researchers’ remunerations in EU25 and
Associated Countries obtained from the survey and converted in terms of
standardised PPS through corrective coefficients, can be compared.




3.2 Analysis
The obtained inventory of the remunerations in the public and private commercial
sectors in EU25 and Associated Countries allows the comparison of the situation of
researchers between countries. This analysis considered the corrective coefficients
(PPS), thus making the different remunerations of researchers comparable, when
factoring in the “real” situation in each country.

On the other hand, the analysis was also extended to compare the situation in
other countries, such as Australia, China, India, Japan and the United States, and
to other similar professions, giving a clear idea of the existing differences between
researchers and more socially recognised professions at equivalent levels, and
differences between researchers working in Europe and researchers working in
other countries.



3.2.1   Comparison of researchers'
     remunerations in EU25 and Associated
     Countries
The analysis and comparison of remunerations of researchers in Europe per country
was carried out using the data collected, and then qualitatively and quantitatively
processed, taking into consideration corrective coefficients to balance the different
cost of living in each country.

The averages of the remunerations (total and net yearly salary averages) of
researchers per country are presented in the following tables in terms of PPS:
