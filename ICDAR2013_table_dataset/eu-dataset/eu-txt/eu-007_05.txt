It is thus evident that the funding and involvement of social partners take different forms, and
that in some countries this involvement will be at national level, while in others it will be at
the sectoral level. Moreover, there is not a uniform trend towards more or less involvement of
social partners. Rather, countries that have little tradition of involving social partners in
education and labour market issues, continue to show little involvement of these actors in the
area of adult education and training, while countries with a tradition of significant
involvement of social partners in the economy and society, extend this involvement to the
area of adult education and training.

With respect to the less formalised means of learning, i.e. learning that is not provided
through education and training courses, it is more difficult to empirically ascertain the role of
the social partners. However, research suggests that social partners have a significant role to
play, in shaping opportunities for on-the-job learning and the creation of learning
organisations. Indeed, rigidities associated with social partners’ narrow professional
classifications based on qualifications acquired from participation in formal education may
prove a significant obstacle to the implementation of flexible learning organisations and the
creation of non-formal and informal education environments for adults. For example, it has
been noted that in Germany “the Beruf concept is seen to be both an internal barrier [to
learning organisations and human resource development in the workplace], preventing
workers from taking on new tasks, and also an external barrier that restricts peoples’ room for
manoeuvre because their occupations are defined in relation to a limited number of work tasks
