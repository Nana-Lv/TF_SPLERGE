4 STUDY FINDINGS
Once the situation of researchers’ remunerations in EU25 and Associated Countries
has been analysed, a number of results out of this work can be figured out.

The total yearly salary has been the main orientation of the study. Figure 12
presents the distribution of countries total yearly salary averages within EU25 and
Associated countries in terms of PPS. The data obtained will help the research
institutions to design better their schemes and make sure they propose attractive
schemes and jobs in comparison to those offered by other institutions, by other
geographical locations and by other professions.

The net yearly salaries obtained in the study are more interesting from the point of
view of researchers. Salary perceived after deductions is one of the elements of
attractive research locations. Others are famous researchers, notoriety, prestige
institutions, etc. Institutions designing policy for researchers are keen to promote
the best practices for proposing attractive research locations. Knowing where the
highest salaries are helps to benchmark attractive research locations. The country
attractiveness from the point of view of researchers is represented in Figure 13.

It can be seen in the country attractiveness map (Figure 13) that most of the
countries stay in the range between 20.000 EUR and 30.000 EUR. The Eastern
countries have the lowest salary and Austria, Cyprus, Israel, Luxembourg, The
Netherlands, Switzerland and The United Kingdom present a salary higher than
30.000 EUR.
