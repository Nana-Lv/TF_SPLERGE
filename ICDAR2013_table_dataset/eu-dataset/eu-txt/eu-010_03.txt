        researchers at National and European level (EARTO, Dante Network, etc.),
        National Contact Points, IRC Network…

   •    Researchers (R): Defined as people carrying out research activities. They are
        the objective of the study.

The number of entries in this initial delivery database was 4.444. From each entry
the following information has been stored: country, type of organisation,
organisation name, contact name, contact email and contact telephone.

A second sending started on July 2006. In this case, a more extensive database of
research contacts (4.115 new contacts), and contacts of researchers involved in
Marie Curie projects, provided by the European Commission (2.731 new entries)
was used.

Additionally and also aiming at improving the survey’s impact, the questionnaire
was forwarded to:

   •    The e-mail list of the ERACAREERS portal, owned by the European
        Commission (http://ec.europa.eu/eracareers/). The email list contains email
        addresses of about:

           o   6.000 active researchers and,

           o   1.500 active organisations.

   •    200 attendees to a conference organised by the Austrian presidency, held in
        Vienna 1-2 June (http://www.eracareersaustria.at/conference/).

In the light of the preliminary results of the survey, the contacts database was
again improved with additional industry contacts. This action aimed to obtain more
data from the researchers working in the industry sector. Thus, 822 new contacts
of industrial companies were included in the database, and a third sending was
done to those new contacts.

For all these contacts, and in order to maximise the impact of the mailing, the
following reminders (for each of the sending) have been sent, as presented in the
table below:
