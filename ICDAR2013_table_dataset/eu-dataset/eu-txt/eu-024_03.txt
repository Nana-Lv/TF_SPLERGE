 Summing up, government bond yield spreads vis-à-vis Germany, albeit having declined recently,
 remain high for a number of countries, indicating continued risk and market uncertainty.
 Securities issuance by euro area governments has been rising since the outbreak of the ﬁnancial
 crisis, especially for short-term issuance. In the last two years governments have started to
 substitute short-term debt with long-term debt. However, the risk associated with reﬁnancing of
 debt remains high, and it is important that governments continue to adhere to their consolidation
 strategies in order to ﬁrmly correct excessive deﬁcits and restore ﬁnancial market conﬁdence.


As regards market-based measures of inﬂation expectations, yields on ﬁve-year inﬂation-
linked euro area government bonds have decreased since the end of November 2011 and stood
in negative territory in early March 2012, while yields on ten-year inﬂation-linked bonds also
trended downwards over the same period (see Chart 26). Five and ten-year spot real yields stood
at around -0.4% and 0.6% respectively on 7 March. Implied forward inﬂation swap rates (ﬁve-year
forward ﬁve years ahead) in the euro area increased moderately in the period under review, edging
up by 8 basis points to stand at 2.4% on 7 March (see Chart 27). In the same period, break-even
inﬂation rates at the same time horizon dropped by 38 basis points to stand at 2.2% on 7 March.

Break-even inﬂation rates have ﬂuctuated markedly in recent months, reﬂecting both the high volatility
of government bond markets and the existence of sizeable liquidity premia. Inﬂation expectations
inferred from bond markets have thus been less reliable than those based on the signals received from
