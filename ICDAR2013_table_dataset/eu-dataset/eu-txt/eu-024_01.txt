Governments in the euro area faced unprecedented funding challenges in 2011, and the
three countries under EU/IMF adjustment programmes had little access to market-based funding.
Despite the challenging market, governments in most euro area countries managed to issue
long-term securities without strong pressures to increase their recourse to short-term funding.
Long-term issuance, however, took place under very different conditions from country to
country. The share of long-term ﬁxed rate debt securities remained broadly unchanged, standing
at 79.0% at the end of 2011. The share of
short-term debt declined, and stood at 10.4%
at the end of 2011 (see Table B). Governments     Chart A Redemptions of medium and

reﬁnancing risks during the crisis. This entails  (as a percentage of GDP)

Redemption of medium and long-term debt
has remained fairly low and stable since
the start of the crisis (see Chart A). Looking                            8                                                            8

area and in most developed countries in 2012.                             6                                                            6
