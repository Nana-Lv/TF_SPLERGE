Volatility in the euro foreign exchange market continued to decline, and thus returned to its
historical average. The implied volatility of the bilateral exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the US
dollar and the Japanese yen, as well as the pound sterling, declined markedly over all maturities in
December 2011 and early January 2012 and stabilised around their respective historical averages
(see Chart 8).

Over the period under review the currencies participating in ERM II have remained broadly stable
against the euro, trading at, or close to, their respective central rates. The Latvian lats traded on the
stronger side of its central rate within the unilaterally set ﬂuctuation band of ±1%.


 Box 1

 THE EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATES OF THE EURO – REVISED TRADE WEIGHTS IN THE LIGHT
 OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION

 In recent years the geographical composition of euro area trade has undergone signiﬁcant
 change, which is also reﬂected in the trade weights of the effective exchange rates (EERs) of the
 euro calculated by the ECB. In particular, the growing importance of emerging economies and
 the steadily intensifying integration of economies in Europe are increasingly shaping the trade
 linkages of the euro area. This box summarises these developments in the context of the recent
 update of the trade weights underlying the euro area’s EERs.
