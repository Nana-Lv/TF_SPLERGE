         The spreads between the yields on long-term government bonds of euro area countries and those
         on corresponding German bonds widened signiﬁcantly in 2011. This is illustrated in Chart B,
         which shows the spreads vis-à-vis Germany. Spreads were at their highest in November 2011,
         and have contracted for most countries since
         then. However, spreads for a number of           Chart C Liquidity premia for German
         countries remain high, indicating continued      government bonds
