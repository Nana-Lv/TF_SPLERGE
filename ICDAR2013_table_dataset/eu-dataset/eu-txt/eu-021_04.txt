In terms of country balance, there is generally a good response from many EU Member States, with
other 100 responses from Germany, the UK, Italy, Belgium, France and Spain; and over 50
responses from the Netherlands, Portugal, Greece, Austria and Sweden. However, it should be
noted that relatively few responses have come from some Member States, and in particular the 10
new Member States. Most respondents indicated that their geographical scope of activities is
European or international. There was, however, a significant number of regional or local
organisations responding (10% of the total).

Subject to the above comments, the responses can be said to represent an important indication of
the views of the research community and research users. However, the low number of responses
from some Member States and in particular the new Member States means that these countries are
under represented in the overall statistics. This factor is being taken into account in the
Commission’s analysis of the results; this consultation is only one source of input from stakeholders
and that views as represented by national governments and European parliamentary representatives
have a strong importance.
