                                                                                   Porcine brucellosis (Brucella suis)


fresh meat3 as regards imports of pigs for breeding and production4 and fresh pig5 meat, sets up
specific regimes to be applied with respect to porcine brucellosis.
1.2.3. Intra-Community trade in pigs
As regards intra-Community trade in porcine animals, Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26
June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and
swine6 introduced the obligation to certify pigs as originating from brucellosis-free herds and
substantiating a test regime to be applied in order to obtain such a status.
However, due to the technical development in pig husbandry, those requirements were
removed from that Directive by Directive 97/12/EEC of 17 March 1997 amends and updates
Directive 64/432/EEC on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals
and swine7.
The disease was thought to have disappeared from some Member States as no clinical cases
had been diagnosed for a number of years. Then, over recent years, outdoor breeding pig herds
were established which were exposed to wild hares. As a result pigs have caught brucellosis
from infected hares.
1.2.4. Reporting and results
Currently, Brucella suis infection is listed in Annex E(II) of Directive 64/432/EEC as a
notifiable disease and Member States are obliged to report annually on its occurrence within
their territory in accordance with Article 8 of the Directive. In the last few years the tendency
to reporting more cases has been observed.
       Reporting period                           Number of cases                      Reporting Member States
2004*                                                  58                                  AT, DE, HU, IT

* 55 isolates obtained from wild boars within a surveillance programme in place in Italy (regions of Piemonte and Liguria)
** 63 isolates obtained from wild boars within a surveillance programme in place in Italy (regions of Piemonte and Liguria)
*** no data provided by Italy.
**** 22 isolates obtained from wild boars within a surveillance programme In place in Italy (regions of Piemonte and
     Liguria)
There are no cases and positive tests for BS infection in BG in 2007


Taking into account this trend and due to the recent enlargement of the European Union with
new Member States where the free range system of keeping pigs is common, the risk of
contact of domestic pigs with wild boars and hares is very high.
Porcine brucellosis is a rarely reported disease in the EU. Seventeen Member States reported
testing of 37,819,547 pigs, of which 21 pigs were positive for Brucella spp.8 In Hungary,
Brucella was not detected in 5,730 tested pig herds.
In 2006, Brucella suis was isolated from domestic pigs by bacteriological tests in Belgium and
Germany. In addition, Brucella suis was also detected in hares in the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Spain and isolated from wild boars in Italy.
