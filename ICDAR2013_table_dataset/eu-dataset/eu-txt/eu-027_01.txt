GOVERNMENT DEBT PROJECTIONS IN PORTUGAL

The third review mission of Portugal’s economic programme took place from 15 to 27 February.
The assessment of staff members from the European Commission, ECB and IMF is that the
programme is on track, with good progress having been made on the ﬁscal, ﬁnancial and structural
front. In the context of the ongoing adjustment from previously accumulated imbalances,
a determined implementation of reforms remains essential to ensure economic recovery and ﬁscal
sustainability. This box presents a set of scenarios for government debt dynamics in Portugal and
focuses on the path of GDP. The scenarios cover the years from 2012 until 2020; a period of
eight years is usually considered sufﬁcient to assess debt sustainability.

Assumptions underlying the baseline calculations

The macroeconomic assumptions used in the baseline scenario are the same as those in the
recently completed review, and envisage a contraction of real GDP in 2012. The scenario
foresees a slow cyclical recovery in 2013 which becomes more robust by 2015. To construct a
baseline for the medium-term debt projections, from 2015 onwards GDP growth is assumed to
be limited to the modest average rate that the country achieved in the decade before the crisis,
i.e. between 1999 and 2008, of 1.6% per annum. This was 0.5 percentage point below the euro
area average and well below the growth rate of the catching-up countries. The ﬁgure corresponds
to the “pre-reforms” estimate of long-term potential growth for Portugal. In other words, the
baseline scenario does not include any positive growth effects from structural reforms. It can
be considered a low estimate of possible GDP growth outcomes, given the signiﬁcant progress
already made by the Portuguese government in the ﬁeld of structural reforms.

In line with the programme assumptions, the projection is based on a gradual improvement in
ﬁnancial market conditions from the second half of 2013, reﬂected in a decline in interest rate
spreads as well as a continuation of the government’s prudent ﬁscal stance. In the baseline
scenario, the government reaches a budget deﬁcit of 0.5% by 2015, as speciﬁed in the August
2011 Fiscal Strategy Document. The resulting consolidation effort translates into a primary budget
surplus which amounts to 4.5% of GDP in 2015 and remains at around 4% of GDP afterwards.
This primary surplus is not particularly high compared with those that other European countries
have been able to maintain in the past for relatively long periods of time.1 The baseline scenario
also factors in the impact of ageing-related spending estimated by the European Commission.

Chart B shows that in the baseline scenario government debt rises from 93.3% in 2010 to
around 115% of GDP in 2013 and progressively declines thereafter. The decline is particularly
pronounced from 2014 onwards and the stock of debt reaches about 96% of GDP in 2020.
The sharp decline is mainly the result of a protracted primary budget surplus. If that surplus

1 Many European countries have been able to maintain primary surpluses in the range of 4% to 5% of GDP for a very long period of time.
  In the euro area, for example, this has been the case for: Belgium, with an average primary surplus of 4.6% between 1989 and 2007;
  Finland, with an average primary surplus in the order of 5.5% in the periods 1970-1990 and 1998-2008; Italy, with an average primary
  surplus of 4.9% between 1995 and 2001; Ireland, with an average surplus of 4.7% between 1988 and 2000. See the box entitled
  “Past experience of EU countries with sustaining large primary budget surpluses”, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, June 2011, pages 94-95.
