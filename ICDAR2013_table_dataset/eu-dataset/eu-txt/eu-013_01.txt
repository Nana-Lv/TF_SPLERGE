                 Figure 8 – Progression of a researching career in each country

In Figure 8, we have represented the final position of each country in the ranking of
researchers' remuneration averages (more than 15 years of experience) on the x-
axis, while the progression of the career appears as a relative position over or
below the “Relative increase line”. As an example, Portugal (PT) although it is
positioned in a medium place in the ranking (15), its position highly over the
“relative increase line” implies that the progression of a researcher from early stage
to experienced is very attractive. This increase represents an increment of the
remuneration of 465,08 % during the researchers’ career.

On the other side, France (FR), which is positioned in a better place in the ranking
(11), presents a less attractive career for a researcher since it is below the “relative
increase line”. This increase represents an increment of 166,07 % during the
researchers’ career.



3.2.2   Comparison of researchers’
     remunerations in the EU25 and associated
     countries against the situation in other
     countries
The comparison of the study results against the situation of researchers in other
countries (Australia, China, India, Japan and the United States) may allow the
Commission to focus better on its objectives and to take appropriate actions in the
context of its human resources development policy in Research. The comparison
was carried out based on the data obtained from the different information sources
in each country (as shown in Table 3). In order to compare all the data obtained, it
