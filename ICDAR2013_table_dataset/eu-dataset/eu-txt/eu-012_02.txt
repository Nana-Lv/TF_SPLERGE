Note: A different analysis has been carried out for the net yearly salary costs
obtained in the survey in order to detect unusual observations. The final sample
had 7.018 correct replies, including 84 answers from Marie Curie fellowships. Marie
Curie answers has not been considered for the calculation of the country net yearly
salary average, as a result the sample had N=6.934).

The following tables present the researchers’ remunerations in each country in
terms of PPS, by gender and level of experience, by sector and by type of contract.
Those figures are expressed in PPS, which considers the difference in the cost of
living between countries.
