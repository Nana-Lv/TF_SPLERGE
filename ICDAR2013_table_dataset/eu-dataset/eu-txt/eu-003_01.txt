  These are the overall figures based on all replies sent during the consultation. There are a couple of cases of coordinated
actions. In one case a group of researchers from different countries have put forward additional comments in favour of a specific
research topic. In another case a group of researcher in one country have submitted exactly the same form. However these two
cases have not significantly affected the overall outcome of the statistics.
