followed by Finland and then UK. The first two are explained by EEI and gender parity
scores in the Netherlands and very high participation rates in Finland.

The UK in fact fares well on the EEI, coming second behind Netherlands on this specific
measure. This suggests that access to higher education across socio-economic groups is no
worse in the UK than in many other countries. What the results of this particular study do
imply, though, is that affordability does not equal accessibility.

3.5. Conclusion

This chapter has suggested that inequitable access to higher education across socio-economic
groups persists. Although most European countries saw a growth in the higher education
sector during the 1990s and a corresponding increase in overall participation, the lower socio-
economic groups remained under-represented. Although commitments to address this have
been pledged, there is no evidence to suggest a resulting positive impact yet.

Focusing on the issue of tuition fees, however, it appears that their introduction does not
necessarily harm access across socio-economic groups. While there is some noteworthy
evidence to suggest that lower socio-economic groups may be highly debt adverse, a large
number of studies have concluded that the presence of tuition fees is not a good indicator of
equitable access. This is not to suggest that tuition fees could not harm access, just that they
cannot be considered in isolation. Tuition fees are one element of the cost and corresponding
financial aid system that must be considered as part of attempts to widen access.

 A high EEI score implies that the composition of the student body ‘looks like’ society as a whole, while a low
EEI score implies that the student body is drawn disproportionately from already privileged families.
