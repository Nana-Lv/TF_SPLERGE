Survey indicators for selling prices in industry,
which lead PPI developments, remained broadly unchanged and close to their long-run averages in
February 2012. European Commission survey data on selling price expectations suggest that this was
due to developments in the consumer goods and capital goods industries, as selling price expectations
in intermediate goods industries are on the rise again. With regard to the Purchasing Managers’ Index,
the output price index for the manufacturing sector rose slightly from 50.7 in January to 51.0 in
February, while the input price index surged from 52.8 to 58.5 over the same period, following recent
commodity price increases and a depreciation of the euro.


3.3 LABOUR COST INDICATORS

Reﬂecting the improvement in labour market conditions in the ﬁrst half of 2011, labour cost
indicators in the euro area increased gradually (see Table 8 and Chart 47). However, the latest data
on wage growth show some signs of stabilisation.
