                                                                                             Final Report


2.3.1.3          Accuracy
Furthermore, the accuracy of the study data was calculated as part of the
qualitative analysis. The complete results, shown in Annex 7, established that the
consistency and reliability of the study results are excellent or high in 20 out of the
33 countries analysed in this study, representing 87,15% of the total number of
researchers in Europe.



2.3.1.4          Weights
Another aspect considered during the qualitative analysis of the survey results, has
been the possible impact that the distribution of responses per level of experience
may have on the calculation of each country average. Thus, a set of weights per
level of experience has been defined, considering the number of responses obtained
in the study. These weights, as presented in the table below, have also been
applied to the results, producing the weighted averages.

                           0-4 years 5-7 years 8-10 years 11-15 years > 15 years TOTAL

In a similar way, weights per level of experience and gender have been calculated
and applied. These weights are presented in the table below.

                       0-4 years    5-7 years    8-10 years      11-15 years    > 15 years     TOTAL

2.3.2            Quantitative analysis
The quantitative analysis process presents the obtained results in a structured
manner, enabling the extraction of conclusions. As a result, the following set of
survey indicators (SI) were defined, grouped within two indicator categories:
 -       Survey Indicator 1 (SI1), presenting the total number of received responses,
         distributed by: country, gender, level of experience, sector of activity and
         scientific domain.
 -       Survey Indicator 2 (SI2), presenting the results of the survey concerning
         salaries in the different countries for the different fields (seniority, gender)
         and the number of received responses for other advantages
SI1: Total number of responses: It classifies the responses received, as follows:
     o    SI1.1:% distribution per country (QC: response to question 1 of the
          questionnaire)
