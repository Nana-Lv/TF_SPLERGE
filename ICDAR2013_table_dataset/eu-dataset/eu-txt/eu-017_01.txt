                                                                Contract number – REM 01
                                                                             Final Report

As it can be seen, although the deviations are not very significant, in general, a
necessity of adjusting the study results was founded and therefore the adjustment
coefficient were defined and applied as explained in chapter 2.3.1.2.




5.7 Annex 7: Accuracy of the results
In order to estimate the significance of the data obtained, the accuracy level has
been calculated, using the formula for the determination of the sample’s size,




Where,
•       N = Total population

•       Zα2 = 1.962 (for confidence interval of 95%)

•       p = margin (for unknown margin ranges, p=0,50 (50%))

•       q = 1 – p = 0,50

•       d = accuracy

The following table presents the number of valid replies per countries, after the in-
depth analysis (outliers), the number of researchers per country as defined by
Eurostat, and the calculated value of d (accuracy).

Four categories of countries results have been established:

•       Excellent: accuracy level <5%

•       High: 5%< accuracy level<10%

•       Medium: 10%< accuracy level<15%

•       Low: accuracy level >15%

Those categories have established the reliability and consistency of the results.
Countries with low accuracy have a less significant sample size than the other
categories so their results must be carefully analysed since the number of
responses taken into account does not provide the minimum accuracy level
demanded in this type of studies.
